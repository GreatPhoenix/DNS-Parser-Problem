# DNS Parser Problem
 This is a test question given by cloud flare for a job application (They ended up not giving me the job)
 
 I put a ton of time into this problem so I wanted to post it on my GitHub.
 
 This program only works with A and AAAA dns queries.
 
 Takes an input from STDIN and outputs to STDOUT.
 
 It is not the best DNS Parser but it gets the job done.
